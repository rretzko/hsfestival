    is licensed to make and use copies of the music only for choral groups directed by that Purchasing Director.
    Copies may not be sold, distributed, or donated to any other individual, organization, church, or school.
    If the Purchasing Director leaves an affiliated school, church, or other organization, the license to reproduce
    goes with the Purchasing Director, and the originals and any copies made during his/her tenure must be removed.

<p>
    <b><u>Purchase by an Organization</u></b><br />
    A single school, church, or independent choral organization that purchases the Sight Reading Materials commissioned

    for any choir(s) directly affiliated with the purchasing organization.
    Copies may not be sold, distributed, or donated to any other individual, organization, church, or school.
    Neither the original nor copies are to go with a re-locating director unless that individual made personal purchase
    of the materials.  (See “Individual Purchase.”)
